# GhidraBinaries
Just the Ghidra projects themselves main= Lab 06 and main7 = Lab 07 


#Assignment/ Project Explaination 

So I just uploaded the zip of the main project for Ghidra that I was working in
In order to run the projeccts you will have to have Ghidra installed on your machine and then open the project directory
to access either 'main' or 'main7'.
DO NOT USE *project.prp* or *projectState*
